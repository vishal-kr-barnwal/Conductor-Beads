Synchronize issues with git remote in a single operation.

## Sync Steps

1. Commit pending changes to Dolt
2. Pull from remote (with conflict resolution)
3. Merge any updates
4. Push to remote

Wraps the Dolt sync workflow for multi-device use.

## Usage

- **Basic sync**: `bd sync`
- **Preview**: `bd sync --dry-run`
- **Custom message**: `bd sync --message "Closed sprint issues"`
- **Pull only**: `bd sync --no-push`
- **Push only**: `bd sync --no-pull`
- **Flush only**: `bd sync --flush-only` (commit to Dolt without pushing)
- **Import only**: `bd sync --import-only` (pull without pushing)

## Separate Branch Workflow

When using a separate sync branch (configured via `sync.branch`), additional commands are available:

- **Check status**: `bd sync --status` - Show diff between sync branch and main
- **Merge to main**: `bd sync --merge` - Merge sync branch back to main branch
- **Preview merge**: `bd sync --merge --dry-run` - Preview what would be merged

### Merge Workflow

When working with a protected main branch and separate sync branch:

1. Beads commits go to the sync branch (e.g., `beads-metadata`)
2. Use `bd sync --status` to review pending changes
3. When ready, use `bd sync --merge` to merge back to main
4. After merge, run `bd import` to update the database
5. Run `bd sync` to push changes to remote

The merge command includes safety checks:
- Verifies you're not on the sync branch
- Checks for uncommitted changes in working tree
- Detects and reports merge conflicts with resolution steps
- Uses `--no-ff` to create a merge commit for clear history

## Note

Most users should rely on the Dolt server's automatic sync (with `dolt.auto-commit` enabled) instead of running manual sync. This command is useful for one-off syncs or when not using the Dolt server.
